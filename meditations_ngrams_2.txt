satisfied with thy present	2
is no man who	2
for neither wilt thou	2
to the end which	2
while it is in	2

content with what happens	2
according to nature is	2
the events which happen	2
out of that which	2
be done without a	2
done without a purpose	2
nothing else than the	2

will no longer be	2
of which we are	2
this is so we	2
is so we are	2
this is so the	2
is in a manner	2
the whole human race	2
it is not contrary	2
contrary to the reason	2
the reason of our	2
these things should be	2
the fig tree to	2
bear this in mind	2
this in mind that	2
a very short time	2
away the complaint i	2
the complaint i have	2
complaint i have been	2
i have been harmed	2
that everything which happens	2
the series of things	2
but with respect to	2
with respect to what	2
in which a man	2
whatever the reason of	2
to change thy opinion	2
what is just or	2
if thou wert going	2
suppose that those who	2
then is this to	2
things which are called	2
of these things is	2
such a thing as	2
the bodies of those	2
bodies of those who	2
of those who have	2
intelligence of the universe	2
of the number of	2

thee are all things	2
it would not be	2
which comes from doing	2
out of the whole	2
do not disturb thyself	2
everything which happens has	2

not know what is	2
and separates himself from	2
from the reason of	2

be content with it	2
of time and of	2
and to be content	2
it is necessary to	2
thus thou wilt not	2
thou wilt not be	2
things which are and	2
of things they avoid	2
things they avoid and	2
avoid and what kind	2
is evil to thee	2
where is it then	2
the power of forming	2
to him who lives	2
who lives according to	2
lives according to nature	2
one substance and one	2
the perception of this	2
and how all things	2
all things are the	2
it is no evil	2
is like a river	2
to those which have	2
the things which come	2
things which come into	2
which come into existence	2
and the death of	2
the universe and the	2
that we ought not	2
act and speak as	2
and all this in	2
all this in a	2
this has happened to	2
has happened to me	2
that a man s	2
which is not a	2
a deviation from man	2
deviation from man s	2
from man s nature	2
to thee to be	2
of man s nature	2
any one else like	2
one else like them	2
of people and in	2
him who lives three	2
this thought be present	2
work of a human	2
of a human being	2
why then am i	2
to do the work	2
do the work of	2
to do that which	2
do that which is	2
according to thy nature	2
the things which they	2
are according to nature	2
be done or said	2
the common nature and	2
through the things which	2
altogether in thy power	2
thou not see how	2
which there is no	2
man when he has	2
he has done a	2
what he has done	2
it has made the	2
a man when he	2
for this reason thou	2
this reason thou wilt	2
but if thou wilt	2
it is said that	2
prescribed to this man	2
it when it is	2
in the first case	2
that which happens to	2
to be such a	2
the things which the	2
be of the same	2
content with that which	2
which happens to thee	2
and be content if	2
be content if the	2
what is more agreeable	2
is more agreeable than	2
for what is more	2
then turn to the	2
morals of those who	2
not to be vexed	2
nothing will happen to	2
for there is no	2
if any man should	2
should not be in	2
be in harmony with	2
but if a man	2
if a man has	2
things which appear to	2
things to be good	2
to be good to	2
formal and the material	2
some part of the	2
part of the universe	2
the universe and that	2
and so on for	2
so on for ever	2
to a man as	2
that which is good	2
just in the same	2
he can also live	2
can also live well	2
it is carried and	2
and the good of	2
the good of each	2
good of each thing	2
that we are made	2
it is impossible that	2
to any man which	2
which he is not	2

good to men and	2

one of the things	2

satisfied with that which	2
assigned to him and	2
art thou angry with	2
thou angry with him	2
angry with him whose	2
show him his error	2
so it is in	2
thy power to live	2
dost thou think that	2
of the rational and	2
of the universe is	2
the inferior things for	2
inferior things for the	2

of the superior and	2
how many things thou	2
many things thou hast	2

and to how many	2
has skill and knowledge	2
or not even a	2
why then dost thou	2
of the poor flesh	2
pass thy life in	2
